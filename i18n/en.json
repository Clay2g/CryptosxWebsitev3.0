        "25": "The OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency), the government entity supervising banks in the US, made the unprecedented decision on July 22nd to allow banks to provide custody of cryptocurrency. Both the continued rise of central banking balance sheets and the continued improvement in the regulatory landscape for crypto ring the bells for crypto as loud as possible. Bitcoin will become mainstream sooner rather than later.",
        "26": "Bitcoin had for a long time two identities: 1 as cypherpunk money - cherishing privacy and financial sovereignty, and 2 as Digital Gold, focusing on a limited and auditable supply of coins. The entrance to the mainstream will heavily limit the first identity. Hopes for financial digital privacy are quietly making room for the more material hopes of holders and speculators for a $100,000 Bitcoin, or maybe even a $1M coin. But this has its price.",
        "27": "On July 5th, The Block shared that the mammoth US cryptocurrency retail brokerage and custody provider Coinbase seems to be in the process of selling blockchain analytics services to the American DEA and IRS. These tools help identify and keep track of activity of cryptocurrency users. On July 20th, 2 days before the OCC announcement, The Block published an article claiming that leading Bitcoin exchanges in the US: Kraken, Gemini and Bittrex have joined Coinbase and Bitgo as part of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 by the G7, which develops policies to combat money laundering. According to the FATF requirements, cryptocurrency exchanges must collect information on the recipients and senders of transactions over $1,000.",
        "28": "This follows the European Union‚Äôs new 5AMLD (The European Union‚Äôs 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive), which came into effect at the start of 2020 and requires exchanges to report all cryptocurrency addresses belonging to clients, making sure each Satoshi is accounted for. These recent developments show a clear trend of Bitcoin being integrated into the traditional governance system with no apparent pushback. This leads us to think that increasingly clear regulations on cryptocurrency will be provided by western governments. Bitcoin will be leaving the regulatory twilight zone in favor of a highly supervised existence. Though Bitcoin‚Äôs network can transfer 1 dollar as easily as a billion, it‚Äôs unlikely, in our opinion, that governments will be highly accepting of unsupervised cross-border activity.",
        "29": "In conclusion: After 11 years, Bitcoin seems to have gotten the government on board, as well as sophisticated institutions. As Bitcoin markets mature, they are becoming more similar to the traditional world‚Äôs markets, not only in financial products but also in increasing demands for regulatory compliance. Bitcoin is closer than ever to going to the moon, but it will become increasingly clear to holders that they must leave the cyberpunk vision behind if they want to cash out.",
